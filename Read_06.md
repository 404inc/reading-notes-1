# CSS: definition and examples
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

**CSS** can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the **color** and **size of headings** and **links**, also it can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as **animation**.
